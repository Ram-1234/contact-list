      includes the academic discipline which uses narrative to describe,
      examine, question, and analyze a sequence of past events, and investigate
      the patterns of cause and effect that are related to them.[6][7]
      Historians seek to understand and represent the past through narratives.
      They often debate which narrative best explains an event, as well as the
      significance of different causes and effects. Historians also debate the
      nature of history and its usefulness by discussing the study of the
      discipline as an end in itself and as a way of providing "perspective" on
      the problems of the present.[6][8][9][10] Stories common to a particular
      culture, but not supported by external sources (such as the tales
      surrounding King Arthur), are usually classified as cultural heritage or
      legends.[11][12] History differs from myth in that it is supported by
      evidence. However, ancient influences have helped spawn variant
      interpretations of the nature of history which have evolved over the
      centuries and continue to change today. The modern study of history is
      wide-ranging, and includes the study of specific regions and the study of
      certain topical or thematic elements of historical investigation. History
      is often taught as part of primary and secondary education, and the
      academic study of history is a major discipline in university studies.
      Herodotus, a 5th-century BC Greek historian is often considered (within
      the Western tradition) to be the "father of history",[13] although he has
      also been called the "father of lies".[14][15] Along with his contemporary
      Thucydides, he helped form the foundations for the modern study of human
      history. Their works continue to be read today, and the gap between the
      culture-focused Herodotus and the military-focused Thucydides remains a
      point of contention or approach in modern historical writing. In East
      Asia, a state chronicle, the Spring and Autumn Annals, was known to be
      compiled from as early as 722 BC although only 2nd-century BC texts have
      survived. History also includes the academic discipline which uses
